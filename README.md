##About our CanSat
  Our ultimate goal is to develop an autonomous tracking rover which is able to recognize a moving object such as humans or the other rover and chase it until it stops. This rover would be beneficial when it comes to space exploration, especially when building a base on the other planet, where there would be very few people. We can use it as carrier robot for example, when carring something from one point to another for example. 
  We are assuming a rover which has LRF and optimal camera. Autonomous tracking is done by the combination of image processing and recognizing distance and direction measured by LRF. Considerring the CanSat regulation, we are making a rover which has microwave sensor and camera in order to realize autonomous tracking.
