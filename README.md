# Wolve'Z CANSAT2020
Mission code in Python for Keio Wolve'Z CaSat project 2020

## Description: About our CanSat
  CanSat is a small satellite sized approximately as small as soda can.
  Our ultimate goal is to develop an autonomous tracking rover which is able to recognize a moving object such as humans or the other rover and chase it until it stops. This rover would be beneficial when it comes to space exploration, especially when building a base on the other planet, where there would be very few people. We can use it as carrier robot for example, when carring something from one point to another. We are hoping this rover would cooperate with humans and make human space activity more efficiant.
  
  We are assuming a rover which has LRF and optimal camera. Autonomous tracking is accomplished by the combination of image processing and distance and direction recognition by LRF. Considerring the CanSat regulation, we are making a rover which has ultrasonic sensor and camera in order to realize autonomous tracking.
